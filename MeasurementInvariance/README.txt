Measurement Invariance (MI) analyses on the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL 6-18)
Most analyses were conducted by me under supervision of Dr vd Sluis and Dr Neale.

Paper was published in 2016:
van der Sluis S, Polderman TJC, Neale MC, Verhulst FC, Posthuma D, Dieleman G. 
Sex differences and gender-invariance of mother-reported childhood problem behavior. 
International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research.

Only the main scripts are given for the different MI levels (Configural/Metric/Strong Factorial/Strict Factorial/Full) tested, and the secondary scripts where specific parameters are constrained or specified (eg cross-item correlations following high modification indices) are not provided because those scripts strongly depend on your own data.
The paper lists and explains the MI levels in text and tables so please check the paper for more info. If you cant download the paper send me an email.

Scrips are provided for the items from the Anxious-Depressed Syndrome scale, in which parameter estimation and specification loosely follows Mplus defaults.
Withdrawn Depressed is provided because that estimates the model in lambda.
